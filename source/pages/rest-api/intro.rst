==================
Introduction
==================

The Data Repository service provides a graphical, web-based interface, whose functionality is discussed in the corresponding user documentation pages.

The Data Repository REST API can be used for interaction with the service via external services or applications, for example for integration with other websites (research community portals) or for uploading or downloading large data sets that are not easily handled via a web browser.

This page will explain the basic concepts, authentication and all existing HTTP requests that can currently be used. The given examples are explained using curl commands.
