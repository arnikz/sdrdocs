The landing page of a deposit is created after completion of the online deposit workflow. In the deposit landing page you can see the deposit's basic details, additional metadata and information about the status of the files contained in the deposit, for example if the data is currently online or offline and therefore needs to be staged.

.. _search-data:

====================
Search and discover datasets
====================
To search for data use the search functionality on the home page. The text entered can be part of a title, keyword, abstract or any other metadata.
Both registered and unregistered users can search for data. Unregistered users can only search for data sets that are publicly accessible.
You can also make search within specific communities, which means the search results will be limited to that community.

Advanced searches can be performed by clicking the Search button, then entering the additional search criteria on the page that is shown. You can set advanced search criteria to search for deposits, collections, schemas, communities or combinations of any of them. You can also order the search results by Title, Creator, Identifier, or Creation date.
