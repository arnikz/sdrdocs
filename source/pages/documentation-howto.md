# Documentation how-to

This page explains how you can edit the documentation, how to generate HTML documentation from the source and how to install the software needed for this. Some handy links:

- The Data Repository documentation page is: [http://repository.surfsara.nl/documentation](http://repository.surfsara.nl/documentation)
- The source code of documentation is on GitHub: [https://github.com/sara-nl/tdrdocs](https://github.com/sara-nl/tdrdocs/tree/master/source/)

When changes are committed using Git and pushed to the SURFsara GitHub repository, the documentation is automatically rebuild and published by readthedocs.org.
