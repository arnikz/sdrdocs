Objects
==============================

Digital objects are stored and maintained by the repository service using a dedicated object storage and definition system. The objects consist of several subojects that contain metadata defined using XML.

Access
==============================

By default, an object is publicly accessible and therefore can be seen and downloaded by anyone interested. To restrict access, the owner or administrator of an object can set access levels. In the table below these restrictions are listed.

============ =========== ========
Access level Per user    Description
============ =========== ========
Public       No          Object, including files and metadata, is open access and accessible to everyone, even anonymous users
Registered   No          Object is accessible only to registered users. Anonymous users can still see metadata, but cannot download files
Private      Yes         Object is only accessible to users specifically given access to it. Metadata is still open though.
