.. _access-grid:

========================================
Access to the National Dutch Grid or LSG
========================================

Access to the Dutch Grid or the :abbr:`LSG (Life Science Grid)` clusters (including non-local access) allows for: 

* submitting :ref:`Grid jobs <first-grid-job>` to multiple clusters via the Grid middleware
* storing data to the :ref:`grid-storage`

Researchers at SURF-affiliated institutes can apply for compute and storage capacity on the Grid by submitting the `SURFsara application form`_. For scientists not affiliated to SURF, rates are based on tailor made packages. Specific details on obtaining accounts can be found in the `Access Grid`_ section of our website. 

Please contact us at helpdesk@surfsara.nl for any inquiry on our possibilities.
