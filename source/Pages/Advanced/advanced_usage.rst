=================
Metadata schema
=================

A metadata schema is a logical plan showing the relationships between metadata fields, normally through establishing rules for the use and management of metadata.
The first question to ask before making a metadata schema is: Is it necessary to create a new metadata schema, or are there already existing metadata schemas which can be adapted for use? We advice to reuse existing schemas. You can find here the `best practices for defining you metadata schema`_.

To define a metadata schema for your data go to your account page. Your current metadata schemas is listed under the Schema part. To create a metadata schema click on "Add Schema".

 To define the metadata schema you need to provide a name, description and add the metadata fields to the schema.

.. _groups:

Groups
=======

A group is a simple bundling of one or more users. They can be used to provide access or administrative privileges to a bunch of people using only a single relation.

To denine a new group or community or to see the list of current groups and communities that you are member of, go to your account page. Click on "Add groupd" or "Add community" to create a new group or community.

A new page will be open where you need to provide name and description for the group or community and invite other members to join.

Communities
==============

Create a new community to bundle collections and deposits under a single entity. With a community, you can add policies to deposits that make sure publications are up to the standards of your community.
