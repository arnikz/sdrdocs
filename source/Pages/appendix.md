# Appendix

This page provides several terms with their descriptions used in data publication.

## Open data
Simply making data available – providing access – is often not enough to be allowed to reuse data. The data has to be available in a format and under a license that allows reuse.

A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike. (see http://okfn.org/opendata/).

## Linked data
If, in addition, the data is also available in a linked data format, this results in new possibilities for use. Linked data have a certain structure(3) allowing for technical interoperability of datawsets. This way data from a variety of sources can be easily linked.

## Data Provenance
Data provenance is providing a historical record of the data and its origins. It refers to the process of tracing and recording the origins of data and its movement between databases. (see http://db.cis.upenn.edu/DL/fsttcs.pdf).

## Persistent identifiers
A unique and persistent code that is coupled to a digital object. With this code, the object can be identified even when the object is moved to a different location.

## DOI
The digital object identifier (DOI) is a unique and stable (or persistent) identifier that ensures that a digital object can be permanently found by any researcher, regardless of changes in the URL where the object is found. A central registry ensures that the user of a DOI will be referred to its current location (http://www.datacite.org/).

All objects stored in the SURF Data Repository will automatically receive a DOI upon publishing. See also 'Persistent identifiers'.

## Certification
An archive holding the [CoreTrustSeal certification](http://www.coretrustseal.org) complies with requirements ensuring that in the future, research data can still be processed in a high-quality and reliable manner (see ).

The SURF Data Repository will be certified with this certification to guarantee a researcher that its data publication is accessible now and in the future.

## Linked data
A term used to describe a recommended best practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting pieces of data, information and knowledge on the Semantic Web using RDF. Linked data refers to data published on the web in such a way that it is machine-readable, that its meaning is explicitly defined, that it is linked to other external data sets, and that in turn it can be linked to from external data sets. (see http://linkeddata.org).
